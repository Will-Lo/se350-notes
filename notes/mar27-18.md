### Contiguous File Allocation
- Single set of blocks allocated to a file at the time of creation
- Only a single entry in the allocation table
    - starting block, length of file
- External fragmentation occurs

### Chained Allocation
- Allocation by individual block
    - Each block points to the next block of the chain
- Only single entry in file allocation table
    - starting block, length
- No external fragmentation
- Can perform consolidation to keep blocks close together
- **Pros**
    - No external fragmentation
    - Easy to increase size
- **Cons**
    - Slower(must traverse through blocks)
    - Best for sequential files

### Indexed Allocation
- File allocation table contains a one-level index for each file
- Index has one entry for each portion allocation to the file
- File allocation table contains block number for each index
- **Pros**:
    - Supports direct access to blocks occupied by file
        - Faster access
    - No external fragmentation

### Access Control List
- Easier to extend than access matrix

## Security

### Basic Principles
1. **Confidentiality:** ensure access only given to authorized entities
2. **Integrity:** ensure information is accurate
3. **Availability:** ensure service is available in the future

### Intruder
-**Masqueradar:** unauthorized individual penetrating access control to exploit a legitimate user (pretending to be someone else)
-**Misfeasor:** a legitimate user who accesses data, programs, resource that are authorized to them, or someone who misuses their privileges
-**Clandestine user:** a user who controls the system to cover their tracks

### Malicious Software
- Program that exploits a specific vulnerability
- **Parasitic malware:** embedded in another program
- **0-day:** A vulnerability unknown by the vendor that is exploited

### Countermeasure: IDS
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system monitor that analyzes system events to identify anomalies

- Composed by:
    - Sensor to collect data
    - Analyzers to make decisions (classifier)
    - User Interface
    
### Countermeasure: Authentication
- Process of verifying an identity
- **Authentication:** ascertaining that someone is who they claim to be
- **Authorization:** refers to what someone is allowed to do

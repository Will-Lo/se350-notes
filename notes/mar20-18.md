### Disk Scheduling Policies
#### First in, first out
- Process requests sequentially
- Fair to all processes
- Approaches random scheduling in performance if there are many processes
- **Pros**:
    - Easy to implement
- **Cons**:
    - Slow

#### Priority based scheduling
- Goal is not to optimize disk but meet other objects
- Other goals include prioritizes short batch jobs, deadlines, etc.
- Can lead to starvation

#### Last In first out
- Good for transaction processing systems
    - Device is given to most recent user, so little disk arm movement
- Possible starvation

#### Shortest Seek Time First
- Select disk I/O request that requires the least movement of the arm to its current position
- Always chose minimum seek time
- Requires knowledge of track position
- **Cons**:
    - Starvation still possible


#### SCAN
- Arm moves in one direction only, satisfying all outstanding requests until it reaches the last track in the direction and reverses it
- Need to know/assume initial direction
- **Pros**:
    - Deterministic
    - Reasonable performance
    - No starvation
- **Cons**:
    - Biased against data most recently traversed


#### C-SCAN
- Restricts scanning to *one direction only*
- When the last track has been visited in a direction, the arm returns to the opposite end of the disk and scan begins again
- **Pros**:
    - Deterministic
    - Reduces delay for new requests
    - Good for real-time systems
- **Cons**:
    - Slower than SCAN

#### N-step-SCAN
- Optimizes SCAN
- Segments disk request queue into subqueues of length N
- Processes subqueues using SCAN


### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
- Organize data which redundancy can be added to improve reliability
- OS views multiple physical disk drives as a single logical drive 
- Allows for recovery as redundant disk capacity stores parity information

#### RAID Level 0
- Not true RAID
- Transfers data quickly
- Not as reliable

#### RAID Level 1
- Get redundancy by duplicating write data
- **Pros**:
    - writes can be done in parallel
    - reads can be serviced by either disk
    - easy to restore
- **Cons**:
    - double cost of writing
    - both disks fail -> cannot restore

#### RAID Level 2
- All disks participate on disk transfers, with synchronized spindles
- error correcting code calculating across coressponding bits on each data disk
    - *Allows single bit errors to be recognize and corrected immediately* without impacting read time
    - Write, all data and parity disks must be accessed => slow
- Overkill

#### RAID Level 3
- Similar to RAID Level 2
- Only uses *one* redundant disk
- uses parallel access, distributed in small strips

#### RAID Level 4
- Uses independent access array, allowing each disk to operate indepdently
    - Allows I/O requests to be run in parallel
- **Pros**:
    - Only 1 disk can fail at a time
    
#### RAID Level 5
- Most common nowadays
- Split parity bits among disks to increase redundancy


#### RAID Level 6
- Increase # of parity blocks, even more redundancy
- Can handle dual failures

## File Systems
- Typical operations
    - Create
    - Read
    - Open
    - Close
    - Write


- **Field**: basic single value element of data
- **Record**: Collection of fields
- **File**: Collection of similar records, single entity
- **Database**: Collection of related data with relationship among elements

### File Management System (FMS)
- Sole interface for users and applications to access files
- **Goals:**
    - Meet data management needs and requirements for user
    - Guarantee file data is valid
    - Optimize performance
    - Provide I/O support
    - Minimize potential for lost/destroyed data
- **Minimal Requirements:**
    - Authorized users can create, delete, read, write, modify files
    - Authorized users have *controlled access* to other users files
    - Authorized users can *control access permissions* for their own files
    - Authorized users can *restructure* their files

## FMS Architecture

#### Device Drivers
 - Lowest level
 - Responsible for starting I/O operations on a device
 - Processes I/O request completion
 
#### Basic File system
 - Only handles data without understanding it
     - Exchanges blocks of data
     - Concerned about placement of blocks
     - Concerned with buffering blocks in main memory
 
#### Basic I/O Supervisor
 - Maintains control structure for device I/O, scheduling, file status
 - Optimizes access to device I/O
 - Manages I/O buffers
 
#### Logical I/O
 - Enables users and applications to access records
 - Provices general purpose record I/O capability
 - Maintains basic data about a file

#### Access Method
- Reflects different file structure
- Different ways to access and process data

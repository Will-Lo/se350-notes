### Disk Scheduling Policies
#### First in, first out
- Process requests sequentially
- Fair to all processes
- Approaches random scheduling in performance if there are many processes
- **Pros**:
    - Easy to implement
- **Cons**:
    - Slow

#### Priority based scheduling
- Goal is not to optimize disk but meet other objects
- Other goals include prioritizes short batch jobs, deadlines, etc.
- Can lead to starvation

#### Last In first out
- Good for transaction processing systems
    - Device is given to most recent user, so little disk arm movement
- Possible starvation

#### Shortest Seek Time First
- Select disk I/O request that requires the least movement of the arm to its current position
- Always chose minimum seek time
- **Cons**: 


#### SCAN
- Arm moves in one direction only, satisfying all outstanding requests until it reaches the last track in the direction and reverses it
- Need to know/assume initial direction
- **Pros**:
    - Reasonable performance
    - No starvation
- **Cons**:


#### C-SCAN
- Restricts scanning to *one direction only*
- When the last track has been visited in a direction, the arm returns to the opposite end of the disk and scan begins again
- **Pros**:
    - Deterministic
    - Reduces delay for new requests
    - Good for real-time systems
- **Cons**:
    - Slower than SCAN

#### N-step-SCAN
- Optimizes SCAN
- Segments disk request queue into subqueues of length N
- Processes subqueues using SCAN


### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
- Organize data which redundancy can be added to improve reliability
- OS views multiple physical disk drives as a single logical drive 
- Allows for recovery as redundant disk capacity stores parity information

#### RAID Level 0
- Not true RAID
- Transfers data quickly
- Not as reliable

#### RAID Level 1
- Get redundancy by duplicating write data
- **Pros**:
    - writes can be done in parallel
    - reads can be serviced by either disk
    - easy to restore
- **Cons**:
    - double cost of writing
    - both disks fail -> cannot restore

#### RAID Level 2
- All disks participate on disk transfers, with synchronized spindles
- 
- Overkill

#### RAID Level 3
- Similar to RAID Level 2 

#### RAID Level 4
- **Pros**:
    - Only 1 disk can fail at a time
- **Cons**:
    - Every write must always write to the
    
#### RAID Level 5
- Most common nowadays
- Split parity bits among disks to increase redundancy


#### RAID Level 6
- Increase # of parity blocks, even more redundancy
- Can handle dual failures

## File Systems
- Typical operations
    - Create
    - Read
    - Open
    - Close
    - Write


- **Field**: basic single value element of data
- **Record**: Collection of fields
- **File**: Collection of similar records, single entity
- **Database**: Collection of related data with relationship among elements

### File Management System (FMS)
- Sole interface for users and applications to access files
- **Goals:**
    - Meet data management needs and requirements for user
    - Guarantee file data is valid
    - Optimize performance
    - Provide I/O support
    - Minimize potential for lost/destroyed data

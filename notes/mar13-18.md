### Priority Inversion
- Can occur in any priority based preemptive scheduling algorithm
- Occurs when a higher priority task ends up waiting for a lower priority task

- Duration of priority inversion depends on unpredictable actions of other unrelated tasks
- Also occurs when you execute a task of a higher priority instead of a task that helps the highest priority task execute sooner (see figure - T2 executing is a priority inversion)![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-03-13 at 1.23.02 PM.png)

- To be unbounded, needs many tasks of medium priority (priority > T3 and < T1)
- Hard to test (requires long critical sections to be easier to spot)

#### Potential fixes:
1. **Priority inheritance** - low priority task that uses resource from higher priority task inherits high priority
2. **Priority ceiling** - Each resource is assigned a priority ceiling equal to the highest priority task which may lock the resource. As tasks run, they may have their priority temporarily raised if they lock the resource.


## I/O Management

### Categories of I/O Devices
1. **Human Readable** - communicates with user (printer, terminal)
2. **Machine Readable** - communicates with electronics (USB, sensors)
3. **Communication** - communicates with remote devices (modems)

### Differences in I/O Devices
1. **Application**
    - Use of device affects the management software
        - i.e. Disks use file management, terminals give higher priority to super users
2. **Complexity of Control**
    - Simple on/off
    - Time dependent
    - Complex, protocol based interaction
3. **Units of transfer**
    - Data transferred either in stream of bytes of blocks
4. **Data representation**
    - Encoding schemes
5. **Error conditions**
    - Devices respond to errors differently
    
### Performing I/O
1. **Programmed I/O**
    - Program is busy-waiting for the operation to complete
2. **Interrupt-driven I/O**
    - Processor continues executing instructions until interrupted when I/O completes
3. **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**
    - DMA module controls the exchange of data between main memory and I/O device, only interrupts after entire memory block transfer completes
    
### Direct Memory Access
- Processor delegates I/O operation to DMA module
- DMA transfers data directly to/from memory
- When transfer completes, DMA sends interrupt signal to processor
- Can have multiple configurations

### OS Design Issues with I/O
1. **Efficiency**
    - Most I/O devices are extremely slow compared to main memory
    - Use of multiprogramming allows interleaving of I/O and processing
    - Swapping is used to bring in additional Ready processes; swapping is an I/O operation
2. **Generality**
    - Handle all I/O devices in a uniform manner

### Model of I/O Operations
- **Logical I/O**
    - treats device as logical resource

### I/O Buffering

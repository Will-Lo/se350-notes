### Priority Inversion
- Can occur in any priority based preemptive scheduling algorithm
- Occurs when a higher priority task ends up waiting for a lower priority task

- Duration of priority inversion depends on unpredictable actions of other unrelated tasks
- Also occurs when you execute a task of a higher priority instead of a task that helps the highest priority task execute sooner (see figure - T2 executing is a priority inversion)![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-03-13 at 1.23.02 PM.png)

- To be unbounded, needs many tasks of medium priority (priority > T3 and < T1)
- Hard to test (requires long critical sections to be easier to spot)

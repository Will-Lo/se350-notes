### Inverted Page Tables
- Index on frame number, not virtual address.

### Translation Lookaside Buffer
- Each virtual memory access can cause two physical memory addresses
    1. Fetch the page table entry
    2. Fetch the data
- **Fix:** add caches

#### Steps
1. CPU checks TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)
2. Check page table entry in TLB?
    - If Yes, CPU generates physical address
    - If No, access page table and check if page is in main memory
        - If page is not found, raise page fault, read page from disk and transfer it to main memory 
        - If page is found, CPU generates physical address, update the TLB
        
### Page size
- Small Page Size
    - less internal fragmentation
    - more pages per process => larger page tables => large portion of page tables in virtual memory
    - more pages benefits from principal of locality => page faults low
- Large Page Size
    - secondary memory transfers larger blocks of data better
    - pages tend to be farther away from recent reference => higher page faults

### Segmentation
- Allows programmer to view memory of multiple address spaces and segments
- Advantages
    - Simplifies handling of data structures by having one structure per segment
    - Allows programs to be altered and recompiled independently by having code and data contain their own segments
    - Shares data among processes by sharing a segment
    - Protection by protecting segments

#### Segment Tables
- Starting address corresponds to segment in main memory
- Each entry contains the length of the segment
- 2 bits are needed to determine if segment is in main memory and if it was modified since loading into main memory

#### Combining Paging and Segmentation
- Each element contains a process, 1 segment table per process, 1 page table per segment
- Segment is visible to programmer, paging is transparent

#### OS Designer needs to make 3 decisions:
1. Does the system need virtual memory?
2. Paging, segmentation, or both?
3. Which algorithms for memory management?
    - Fetch policy
    - Placement policy
    - Replacement policy
    - Cleaning policy
    - Load control
---

#### Fetch Policy
- Determines when a page should be brought into main memory
- **Demand paging**: only bringing pages into main memory when a reference is made to location on the page => lots of page faults in the beginning of process
- **Prepaging**: brings in more pages than needed to improve efficiency

#### Placement Policy
- Determines where in real memory a process piece is to reside
- Important when segmenting a system

### Replacement Policy
- Determines which page to replace
- Should remove the page that is least likely to be referenced in the future -> principle of locality
- Frame locking
    - Restricts placement policy
    - If frame is locked, cannot be replace
    - Tracks locked/unlocked via lock bit w/each frame

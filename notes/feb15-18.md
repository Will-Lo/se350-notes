## Paging:
- Partition memory into small equal fixed sized chunks
- Chunks of process = page
- Chunks of memory = frame

Maintain a page table for every process

Memory address consists of:
1) A page number
2) An offset

--- 

## Segmentation
- Program is divided into segments
- All segments of programs can be different lengths
- Addressing consists of two parts
    - Segment number
    - Offset
- Segments are not always equal, so similar to dynamic partitioning (unlike paging)

Can run out of segments and still have memory available

| Method        | Description  | Pros | Cons|
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Fixed Partitioning | Divide memory into fixed size paritions| Easy to implement | Inefficient use of memory from external fragmentation
| Dynamic Partitioning   | Partitions are created so each process is loaded into a partition of process size    | Efficient use of memory, no internal fragmentation | Uses a lot of CPU resources for compaction
| Simple Paging | Main memory is divided into equal-sized frames. Processes are split into pages, load all pages into available frames   | No external fragmentation | Some internal fragmentation
| Simple Segmentation | Process is split into segments, load segments into dynamic partitions | No internal fragmentation, less overhead and better memory utilization than dynamic partitioning | External Fragmentation

## Virtual Memory:
Load the program's code and data on demand
- Read, load from disk
- If memory is unused, write to disk

_A program can be run without being fully run in memory_

Need to know:
    1. Next instruction to execute
    2. Next data that needs to be accessed

To do:

1. Load part of the program
2. Keep reading from RAM until cannot find next page in RAM (page fault)
3. Block the process, read in data, resume

Allows more processes to be run at once, a process can exceed RAM size

## Thrashing
- Need to compute what you want to throw out
- Principle of Locality
    - Stuff you need in the future is close to stuff you need in the past

## Address Translation
- Using Page tables
    - Use virtual address to check page in page table
    - Need to keep page table in RAM -> inefficient
    

- 2 Level Hierarchical Page Table
    - Put page tables in virtual memory
    - Tells you where the page tables are stored in memory
    - More efficient
    - Cons:
        - Page table size is proportional to virtual address spae
        - Can run into 2 page faults at once

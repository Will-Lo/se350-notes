## Microkernals

* Small operating system core

* Contains only essential core operating systems functions

* Other services happen as user processes

* Drivers

* File systems

* Virtual memory management

* Windowing system

* Security services

**Microservices are slower than monoliths because it has to pass information from applications to kernel to pager**

* duplicated data among processes

### Advantages:

* Reliability

* Portability

* Distributed system support

* OOP

## Multicore and Multithreading

_**If you have N processors, is your program now N times faster?**_

* Almost!

  * Small delay in processors telling that they have finished their task

  * I/O to the same device \(for certain devices i.e. harddrive without SATA\)

### Benefits of Multiprocessor/core

* Speed, every process can run independently

* Multithreaded native applications

* Multiprocess applications \(Chrome\)

* Virtualized lanugages \(JVM\)

* Multiinstance applications \(browser windows\)

## Concurrency \(toilet analogy\)

**Key terms**

_**Critical section:**_ A section of code within a process that requires access to shared resources which may or may not be executed while another process is in a corresponding section of code \(use washroom\)

_**Deadlock:**_ A situation where two processes are unable to proceed as each one is waiting for the other to do something \(1 person has toilet, other has toilet paper\)

_**Livelock:**_** **A situation where two or more processes continuously change their state in response to changes in other processes without doing any useful work \(arguing\)

_**Mutual exclusion:**_ Requirement when one process accesses shared resources in a critical section, no other process must access those resources \(toilet\)

_**Race Condition:**_ A situation where multiple processes read/write a shared data item and the final result depends on their relative timing

_**Starvation:**_ A situation where a process is overlooked indefinitely by scheduler and never run \(being bullied out of your spot in washroom\)

### Challenges:

Sharing global resources

Hard to debug

OS optimal resource management

### Operating System Concerns:

* Keep track of various processes
* Allocate and deallocate resources
* Processor time
* Memory
* Files
* I/O devices
* Why should concurrency not be reliant on the process speed? \(why should the washroom lock not rely on how long you take?\)

### Interaction among Processes

1. Processes unaware of each other

2. Processes indirectly aware of each other

3. Processes directly aware of each other

### Mutual Exclusion

* Critical sections \(requires this\)

* Only one program at a time is allowed in its critical section \(i.e. read/write to a file\)

## Requirements of Mutual Exclusion

1. Enforcement: Only one processes at a time is allowed in the cirtical section for a resource \(door lock\)

2. A process that halts in its noncirtical section must do so without interfering with other processes

3. No deadlock or starvation

4. A process must not be delayed access to a critical section when no other process is using it

5. No assumptions are made about relative process speeds or number of processes

6. A process remains in its critical section for a finite time only

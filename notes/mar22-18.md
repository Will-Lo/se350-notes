## File Management Functions
- identify and locate a file
- use a directory to describe location of files and their attributes
- describe user access control

### Criteria
- Short access time
- Ease of update
    - Not a concern for CD-ROM files
- Economy of storage
     - minimum redundancy
- Simple to maintain
- Reliability

### The Pile (Laundry Pile)

- Data collected in the order as it arrives
- No structure
- Access records by exhaustive search
- Useful when data is only collected and stored before processing

### The Sequential File (Ordered Laundry Pile)

- Fixed format records, same length
- Key file field identifies the record
- Search is still terrible
- Hard to update, as physical organization matches logical organization
    - Updates rearrange file

### Indexed Sequential File (Color sorted laundry Pile)

- Index provides a lookup capacity to quickly reach vicinity of desired record
    - Contains key and pointer to main file
    - Finds the highest key file that equals to or precedes the desired key value 
- Orders of magnitude faster than sequential file for searches
- New records added to overflow file
- Merge overflow files to main file during batch updates
- Can have multi index levels to increase efficiency

### Indexed File

- Multiple indexes for different key fields
- May contain exhaustive or partial index
- Easier to group than indexed sequential file

### Hashed
- Directly access block at a known address
- Requires a key field for every record

---

## Directories
- Contains information about files
    - Attributes
    - Location
    - Ownership
- Provides mapping between file names and files themselves
- ** Basic Information: **
    - File Name
    - File Type
    - File Organization
- ** Address Information:**
    - Volume
    - Starting Address
    - Size used, allocated
- **Access Control Information:**
    - Owner
    - Access Information
    - Permitted Access
- **Usage Information:**
    - Date created
    - ID of owner
    - ...

### Single List Directory
- **Approach 1: Single list**
    - One entry for each file
    - Sequential file with name serving as key
        - No dup names
    - Does not help to organize
- **Approach 2: One list per user**
    - One directory for each user and a master directory
    - Limits of entries per user (list)
    - Master directory contains entry for each user
    - Does not help structuring collections of files
- **Approach 3: Tree Structure**
    - Master directory with user directories underneath
    - Each directory may have sub-directories or files 
    - Used today

### File Sharing
- In multiuser systems, allow files to be shared among users
- Two Issues
    - Access rights
    - Management of simultaneous access
    
#### Access Rights
- **None**
    - User may not know existence of a file
    - User not allowed to read directory that includes the file
- **Knowledge**
    - User only knows file exists and who the owner is
- **Execution**
    - The user can load and execute a program but not copy it
- **Reading**
    - The user can read the file and copy it
- **Appending**
    - The user can add data to the file but not modify or delete any of the file contents
- **Updating**
    - User can modify, add, and delete file data
- **Changing Protection**
    - User can control access rights given to other users
- **Deletion**
    - User can delete file
- **Owners:**
    - has all of the above rights
    - may grant rights to others
    
#### Simultaneous Access
- User may lock entire file when it is being updated
- May lock individual records during update
- Mutual exclusion and deadlock

--- 

### Record Blocking
- Organize records in blocks on I/O device
- Variable or fixed size?
- Relative block size to average record size?
- **Fixed Blocking**
    - Fixed-length records
- **Variable Blocking: Spanned**:
    - Some records span 2 blocks with a continuation pointer

- **Variable Blocking: Unspanned**:
    - Variable length records without spanning

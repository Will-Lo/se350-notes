## Memory Management

* Subdividing memory to accommodate multiple processes

* Memory needs to be allocated to ensure a reasonable supply of ready processes to consume available processor time

### Requirements

* **Relocation**

  * Programmer does not know where the program will be placed in memory -&gt; security, conveniece

  * Could be swapped to disk and returned to main memory later during execution \(relocation\)

* **Protection**

  * Processes should not be able to reference memory locations in another process without permison

* **Sharing**

  * Allow several processes to share the same portion of memory

* **Logical Organization**

  * Programs are written in module

  * Modules can be written and compiled independently

  * Share modules among processes

## Approches

#### Fixed sized partitions

* Any process whose size is less than or equal to the partition size can be loaded into an available partition

* If all partitions are full, the operating system can swap a process out of a partition

* Can be either equal-size or unequal-size

  * Unequal-size partitions have processes go into a queue for a partition of a certain size

  * Unequal-size runs into problems when multiple processes of the same size queue up to the same partition

#### Dynamic Partitioning

* Partitions are of variable length and number

* Eventually get holes between memory spaces, called external fragmentation

* Uses algorithms to decide which block to allocate to a process

  * Best-fit \(worst\), first-fit \(fastest\), next-fit \(least waste\)

  * Best-fit: allocates to the block that is closest in size to the process

  * First-fit: allocates to the first block that can fit the process

  * Next-fit: allocates to where the last placement was done, usually has the most space available

* Buddy system: Entire space is considered 2^u space

  * if process size is the size of 2^u, it is allocated, otherwise split into 2 equal buddies

  * pros: no external fragmentation needed

  * cons: a lot of internal fragmentation

* A process may occupy different partitions, which means different absolute memory locations during execution

* Compaction will also cause a program to occupy a different location

### Addresses

* Logical

  * Reference to the memory location independent of the current assignment of data to memory

  * must be translated to physical address

* Relative

  * Relative based on where you are right now

* Physical

  * Absolute address of location in main memory

#### Page Buffering
    - Implements a cache for memory pages
    - Replaced page is added to one of two lists
        - Free list or modified page list
    - OS can revive pages from the list if space is available

### Resident Set
- Pages of process in memory
    - The smaller the amount, the more processes
    - Too small => high fault rate
    - Too big => no real gain

#### Resident Set Size
    - **Fixed-allocation**
        - Gives a process a fixed number pages to execute from
        - When a page fault occurs, one of those pages must be replaced
        - **Local scope**
            - Decide ahead of time the amount of allocation to give to a process (hard)
            - Hard to determine if allocation is too small or too large
    - **Variable-allocation**
        - Number of pages allocated to a process varies over time
        - Easiest to implement
        - Implemented in most OS
        - OS keeps list of free frames, free frame added to resident set when a page fault occurs
        - Replaces anyone if no free frame
        - **Risk**: process can suffer resident set size reduction
        - **Local Scope**
            - When process is added, allocate number of frames based on some criteria (i.e. application type)
            - When age fault occurs, select page from resident set of process that suffers the fault
            
#### Working set 
- The set of pages of processes that has been referenced in last _t_ time units, which approximates the set of pages of a process that will be accessed in the future
- Steps to implement:
    1. Monitor working set of each process
    2. Remove pages from the resident set but not the working set (LRU)
    3. Process may only execute its working set if its in main memory
- **Cons**: Not practical to implement, past does not predict future, optimal window size unknown

### Cleaning Policy
- Best approach uses page buffering
    - Replaced pages are placed in modified and unmodified lists
    - Pages in modified list are periodically written out in batches
    - Pages in unmodified list are reclaimed if referenced again or lost if frame assigned to another page

### Load Control
- Determines # of processes that will be resident in main memory
- Too few processes lead to many occasions where all processes are blocked, requiring time swapping
- Too many processes leads to thrashing

### Multiprogramming
- How to determine how much multiprogramming to use?
- Aim for **L=S criterion:** avg time between faults = time to process a fault
- Which process to swap out (suspend) if multiprogramming is to be reduced?
    - Lowest priority process
    - Faulting process
        - will be blocked anyways because its working set is not in main memory
    - Last process activated
        - least likely to have its working set resident
    - Process with the smallest resident set
        - requires the least future effort to reload (goes against principal of locality)
    - Largest process
        - most free frames

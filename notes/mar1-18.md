#### Page Buffering
    - Implements a cache for memory pages
    - Replaced page is added to one of two lists
        - Free list or modified page list
    - OS can revive pages from the list if space is available

### Resident Set
- Pages of process in memory
    - The smaller the amount, the more processes
    - Too small => high fault rate
    - Too big => no real gain

#### Resident Set Size
    - **Fixed-allocation**
        - Gives a process a fixed number pages to execute from
        - When a page fault occurs, one of those pages must be replaced
        - **Local scope**
            - Decide ahead of time the amount of allocation to give to a process (hard)
            - Hard to determine if allocation is too small or too large
    - **Variable-allocation**
        - Number of pages allocated to a process varies over time
        - Easiest to implement
        - Implemented in most OS
        - OS keeps list of free frames, free frame added to resident set when a page fault occurs
        - Replaces anyone if no free frame
        - **Risk**: process can suffer resident set size reduction
        - **Local Scope**
            - When process is added, allocate number of frames based on some criteria (i.e. application type)
            - When age fault occurs, select page from resident set of process that suffers the fault
            
#### Working set 
- The set of pages of processes that has been referenced in last _t_ time units
- Uses:
    1. Monitor working set of each process
    2. Remove pages from the resident set but not the working set (LRU)
    3. Process may only execute its working set if its in main memory
- Not practical to implement, past does not predict future, optimal window size unknown

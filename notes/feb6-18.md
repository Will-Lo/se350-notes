## Deadlocks

### Conditions for a deadlock to occur:
1. **Mutual Exclusion** - only one process may use a resource at a time
2. **Hold and wait** - a process may hold allocated resources while waiting assignment for others
3. **No Preemption** - no resource can be forcefully removed from a process that holds it, requires rollback or saving state
4. **Circular wait** - a process holds a resource needed by the next process in the chain (closed loop structure)

### Avoid deadlocks by design:
1) Can't really do anything
2) Require a process to request its resources all at once
3) Process must release resource and request again, or pre-empt a process to release resources
4) Define a linear ordering of resource types

### Avoiding deadlocks by execution time:
- Do not grant incremental resource request to a process if the allocation leads to a deadlock
- Banker's Algorithm

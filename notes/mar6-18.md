## Uniprocessor handling

#### Priorities
- Scheduler always chooses higher priority over lower priority
- Use multiple ready queues to represent priority levels
- Lower-priority may suffer starvation
    - Allow processes to change its priority based on age

** Priority based scheduling is non-preemptive **

#### Scheduling policies
1. **Non-preemptive **
    -  Once a process is in a running state, it will run until terminated or blocks itself with I/O

2. ** Preemptive **
    - Currently running process may be interrupted and moved to the ready state
    - Allows for better service as one process cannot eat up processor for long.

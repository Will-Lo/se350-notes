## Uniprocessor handling

#### Priorities

* Scheduler always chooses higher priority over lower priority
* Use multiple ready queues to represent priority levels
* Lower-priority may suffer starvation
  * Allow processes to change its priority based on age

** Priority based scheduling is non-preemptive **

#### Decision Modes

1. **Non-preemptive **

   * Once a process is in a running state, it will run until terminated or blocks itself with I/O

2. ** Preemptive **

   * Currently running process may be interrupted and moved to the ready state
   * Allows for better service as one process cannot eat up processor for long.

3. ** Cooperative **

#### First-Come-First-Served

* Oldest process in ready queue is served
* Non-preemptive
* **Pros:**
  * Good for computation-intensive processes
  * Favours CPU-bound processes
* ** Cons: **
  * Short process will wait a very long time before execution

#### Round Robin

* Use preemption based on a clock, clock creates interrupts
* When interrupt occurs, currently running process is placed in ready queue
  * Next ready job is selected
* Need to pick a good quantum for effective time slicing
* **Pros:**
  * Good overall strategy
* **Cons:**
  * processor-bound processes receive an unfair share

#### Shortest Process Next

* Nonpreemptive policy
* Process with shorted expected processing time is selected next
* **Pros:**
  * Good for minimizing waiting time
* **Cons:**
  * Predictability of longer processes is reduced
  * Possibility of starvation for longer processes or they can be aborted if estimated incorrectly
* Fix: Shortest Remaining Time

#### Shortest Remaining Time

* Preemptive version of SPN
* Estimate processessing time
* Starvation of longer processes
* **Pros:**
  * Better general turn-around time than SPN
  * No bias for long processes like in FCFS
* **Cons:**
  * Elapsed service time must be recorded

#### Highest Response Ratio Next

* Choose next process with the greatest ratio
* Accounts for age and short processes \(better ratio\)
* Still needs to know the service time

#### Feedback-based Scheduling

* Select the first job of the lowest queue \(highest priority queue\) that is not empty
* Penalize jobs that have been running longer
* Uses: If you have one application that creates a number of processes that block the CPU 
* **Pros:**
  * Reduces turnaround time
* **Cons:**
  * Complex
  * Starves tasks that drop to the last queue \(if first queue is filled with multiple short tasks\)
  
## Summary
| | FCFS | Round Robin| SPN | SRRT | HRRN | Feedback |
| :--: |:--:| :--:| :--:| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Decision Mode | Non-preemptive | Preemptive | Non-preemptive | Preemptive | Non-preemptive | Preemptive
| Throughput | Not emphasized | May be low with a low quantum | High | High| High| Not emphasized|
| Response time 


#### Fair-Share Scheduler

* Users application runs as a collection of processes \(threads\)
* CPU usage is equally distributed among system users or groups, as opposed to equal distribution among processes.

#### UNIX Scheduling

* Multilevel feedback with round robin with multiple priority queues
* Preempts processes that are not finished or blocked within 1 second
* Recompute priorities every second

## MultiProcessing Systems
#### Classifications
- Loosely coupled or distributed multiprocessor, or cluster
  - Each processor has its own memory and I/O channels
  - Classical distributed system

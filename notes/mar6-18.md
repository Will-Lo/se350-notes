## Uniprocessor handling

#### Priorities
- Scheduler always chooses higher priority over lower priority
- Use multiple ready queues to represent priority levels
- Lower-priority may suffer starvation
    - Allow processes to change its priority based on age

** Priority based scheduling is non-preemptive **

#### Scheduling policies
1. **Non-preemptive **
    -  Once a process is in a running state, it will run until terminated or blocks itself with I/O

2. ** Preemptive **
    - Currently running process may be interrupted and moved to the ready state
    - Allows for better service as one process cannot eat up processor for long.

3. ** Cooperative **


#### First-Come-First-Served

- Oldest process in ready queue is served
- Non-preemptive or preemptive
- **Pros:**
    - Good for computation-intensive processes
    - Favours CPU-bound processes
- ** Cons: **
    - Short process will wait a very long time before execution

- Use preemption based on a clock, clock creates interrupts
- When interrupt occurs, currently running process is placed in ready queue
    - Next ready job is selected
- Need to pick a good quantum for effective time slicing
- **Pros:**
    - Good overall strategy
- **Cons:**
    - processor-bound processes receive an unfair share
    
#### Shortest Process Next

- Nonpreemptive policy
- Process with shorted expected processing time is selected next
- Problems:
    - Predictability of longer processes is reduced
    - Possibility of starvation for longer processes or they can be aborted if estimated incorrectly
- Fix: Shortest Remaining Time
    
#### Shortest Remaining Time

- Preemptive version of SPN
- Estimate processessing time
- Starvation of longer processes
- **Pros:**
    - Better general turn-around time than SPN
    - No bias for long processes like in FCFS
- **Cons:**
    - Elapsed service time must be recorded
    
#### Highest Response Ratio Next

- Choose next process with the greatest ratio
- Accounts for age and short processes (better ratio)

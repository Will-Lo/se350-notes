## Threads, SMP, and Microkernals

#### Multithreading
 - OS supports multiple thread execution in a single process

### Processes vs Threads
- Processes: (The room analogy)
    - Have virtual address space which holds the process image
    - Processes own threads
- Threads: (Roomate analogy)
    - Threads cannot exist without a process
    - All thread share memory within a process
    - Has a saved thread context when not executing

### Benefits of Threads:
- Takes less time to create a new thread than a proces
    - Kernal not involved to allocate resources => 10x faster
- Takes less time to terminate a thread than a process
    - Kernal not involved to release resources
- Faster the switch between threads
- More efficient communication
- Threads within a process share memory
---

### Thread uses in MultiProcessing System (Single User)
- Async processing
- Speed of execution
    - Multiple threads on multiple CPU/cores, I/O blocking handled
- Modular programming structure

### Thread behaviour in a Process
- Suspending a process suspends all threads in a process because they share the same address space

## MultiThreading Models
#### 1) Many to Many Model
- Multiple user threads to the same number or less kernel threads
- Best accuracy on concurrency; if one thread is blocked, kernel can schedule another thread to be executed
- Cons: difficult to implement, kernel threads are resources

#### 2) Many to One Model
- Many user threads to one kernel thread
- Threads are managed by user library
- Cons: ** If one thread is blocked, the entire process is blocked **
- Good for systems that don't support multi threading

#### 3) One to One Model
- One user thread to one kernel thread
- More concurrent than Many to One model
    - Allows other threads to be run when a thread makes a blocking call
- Cons: creating a user thread requires a corresponding kernel thread

## Kernel level threads vs User-level threads

### User-level threads

- Application handles all the threads
- Uses application threading library
- Kernal schedules processes
- Advantages:
    - Can run on any OS, even if the OS does not support threads
    - Less switching overhead (save 2 mode switches)    
- Disadvantages:
    - Reliant on the OS to integrate threads efficiently

### Kernel-level threads
- Kernel knows context of the threads
- Kernel schedules the threads
- Advantages:
    - Only blocks a single thread
    - Can schedule threads simultaneously on multiple processors
- Disadvantages: 
    - Must rely on the kernal's scheduling algorithm

## Deadlock Avoidance
- A decision is made dynamically whether the current resource allocation request will, if granted, potentially lead to a deadlock
- Requires knowledge of future process requests

Two Methods

1) Do not start a process if its demands might lead to a deadlock
2) Do not grant an incremental resource request to a process if the allocation  might lead to a deadlock

## Resource allocation Denial
- _Banker's Algorithm_
- Safe state: where there is at least one sequence that does not lead to a deadlock 
- #### Goal: Always have a safe state

### Conditions and Requirements:
- Maximum resource requirement must be stated in advance
- Processes must be independent
- Fixed number of resources to allocate
- No process can exit while holding resources

### Deadlock detection:
- When none of the processes can be run due to not enough available resources
- Fixes:
    - Abort all deadlocked processes
    - Backup all processes and rewind, but can cause deadlock again
    - Abort processes until deadlock is gone

### Unix Concurrency Mechanisms:
- Pipes: Producer/consumer data passing between two programs
- Messages
- Shared Memory
- Semaphores
- Signals: implement asynchronous events

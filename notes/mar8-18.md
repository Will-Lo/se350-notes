### Goals of processor scheduling
- 

#### Classifications
- Loosely coupled or distributed multiprocessor, or cluster
  - Each processor has its own memory and I/O channels
  - Classical distributed system
- Functionally specialized processors
  - I/O processor
  - FPGA card
- Tightly coupled multi-processing

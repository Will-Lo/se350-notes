## Semaphores 

### A concurrency control mechanism based on a special variable used for signalling

* Initialized as an integer

* Processes are suspended until the semaphore signal is sent

* semWait\(\) decrements value

* semSignal\(\) increments value



### Binary Semaphore - between 0 - 1

**Counting Semaphore consists of an integer and a queue**

* If integer value of semaphore &lt; 0 for semWait\(\), place process in queue and block it

* If integer value of semaphore &lt;= 0 for semCount\(\), remove process in queue and move to ready list

### Counting semaphore vs binary semaphore

* Counting semaphore allows multiple processes to access the same resource

The initial number of a semaphore indicates the number of processes the resource can handle

* Current value indicates the negative value of how many processes are blocked

## Producer Consumer Problem

* Concurrency problem: one or more producers are generating data and putting them in a buffer

* Single consumer takes items out of the buffer one at a time

* Either the producer or consumer can access the buffer at any given time



## Monitors

*  Local data variables are accessible only by the monitor
*  Shared data in montior is "safe"
*  Process enters monitor by invoking one of its procedures
* Only one process may be executing in the monitor at a time
* Mutex \(Mutual exclusion object\)
* Uses condition variables for signaling
* Unused signals are lost \(unlike sephamore\)

### Pros:

* Application developers do not need to worry about mutual exclusion

* Only one thread can execute in the montior at a time

### Synchronization

* Sender and receiver may not be blocking

### Addressing

* Direct addressing

* Send: includes unique identifier of destination process

* Receive: could know ahead of time from which process it expects a message from

* Indirect addressing

* Messages sent to a shared data structure of queues

* Process sends to a mailbox, other process picks up message from mailbox

### Reader/Writer Problem

* Any number of readers can read at the same time,

* Only one writer at a time

* No readers can read when a writer is writing
